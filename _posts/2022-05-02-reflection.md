# **Reflection of ENGL 350**
  
## General Thoughts on the Course
  
  To tell you the truth, ENGL 350 wasn't what I was expecting it to be, though I don't mean that in a negative sense.  I registered for the class since it fulfilled a portion of my English degree, but I didn't really look much into it aside from that aspect.  I was very pleasantly surprised once the blogs were introduced, as it was the first time I was really given an opportunity to code since dropping my Computer Science major back in 2019.  Working more closely on the digital aspect of writing, as opposed to regular word processor work, was a nice change of pace.  I suppose my biggest gripe with the class is that we didn't get to do a whole lot of blog work throughout the year.  As it stands, this is the fourth and final blog post, and I would have liked to do a bit more.  This may just be me, but I think replacing the Twitter posts with biweekly blogs pertaining to the course would have proved to be more enjoyable, and would have had me think more deeply about what exactly Digital Humanities encompasses.  The inherent requirement to analyze a topic more closely when given a longer format for writing would have worked a bit better for me, but I may be alone in this thinking.
 
  
## The Blogs, and Twitter
  
  As hinted at in the previous section, my favorite part of the course was the different blog assignments.  For me, Twitter has never really worked well with how I write, as I tend to be a tad long winded, and the 140 character limit proves to be quite challenging.  For a bit of a visual aid, here's a screenshot of my Twitter account as it sits now at the end of the semester: ![Twitter](https://llcoolm495.github.io/MattENGL350/images/twitter.png) 
  I suppose I was just never able to think of anything really meaningful to post which came in under 140 characters, and although you can make threads nowadays on Twitter, the idea of such a stringent limit on words was very off-putting to me.  This is a part of the reason as to why I missed a large number of the Twitter post deadlines, though to be honest, the biggest reason for my lack of Twitter posts is due to my continuing time management issues.  With the blog posts, I was able to write in a way that just felt more, for lack of a better word, *right*.  In this regard, the blogs, although they involve much more writing, always felt more doable for me, and even fun.  It was very enjoyable to toy around with GitHub alongside writing assignments, and the blogs were quite refreshing to work on after a few years of being more or less relegated to the standard MLA sort of essay writing.  

   
 ## The Grant Project
  
  The grant assignment was another welcome, although somewhat challenging, change of pace.  The most difficult part of the project for me was actually coming up with an idea that didn't seem, well, like something I would come up with.  I tend to be a bit predictable with my ideas, as they invariably always end up involving something I am interested in.  People who know me well will be able to tell you that something like 80% of what I say either involves cars, computers, or one of my other many specific interests, and I was aiming to avoid banking on that with the grant assignment.  As it turns out, I was unable to overcome this tendency, and ended up basing my grant on a project involving the history of General Motors.  Thankfully, with a good bit of advice and guidance from Dr. Stover, I was able to actually turn it into something that I believe would constitute a Digital Humanities project, and I'm pretty happy with how the final draft turned out.  Additionally, writing the grant for this course made me think more about what exactly Digital Humanities really is, in the same sort of way that the blog posts did.  Unlike the blog posts, however, the grant assignment made me think much more deeply about the true meaning of this sort of field, and how to both recognize and create, at minimum, the *idea* for a Digital Humanities project.  Dr. Stover provided fantastic guidance in the creation of this project, and showed me a website with a DH project similar (in form) to the theoretical project I had planned.

 ## Final Thoughts
  Overall, I would say I enjoyed the course.  The introduction to the field of Digital Humanities was quite interesting, and apart from my own grievances pertaining to Twitter, I don't have any real complaints.  Thanks for a good semester, and I hope everyone enjoys the well deserved break over Summer!
