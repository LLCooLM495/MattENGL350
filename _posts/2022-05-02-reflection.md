# **Reflection of ENGL 350**
  
## General Thoughts on the Course
  
  To tell you the truth, ENGL 350 wasn't what I was expecting it to be, though I don't mean that in a negative sense.  I registered for the class since it fulfilled a portion of my English degree, but I didn't really look much into it aside from that aspect.  I was very pleasantly surprised once the blogs were introduced, as it was the first time I was really given an opportunity to code since dropping my Computer Science major back in 2019.  Working more closely on the digital aspect of writing, as opposed to regular word processor work, was a nice change of pace.  I suppose my biggest gripe with the class is that we didn't get to do a whole lot of blog work throughout the year.  As it stands, this is the fourth and final blog post, and I would have liked to do a bit more.  This may just be me, but I think replacing the Twitter posts with biweekly blogs pertaining to the course would have proved to be more enjoyable, and would have had me think more deeply about what exactly Digital Humanities encompasses.  The inherent requirement to analyze a topic more closely when given a longer format for writing would have worked a bit better for me, but I may be alone in this thinking.
 
  
## The Blogs, and Twitter
  
  As hinted at in the previous section, my favorite part of the course was the different blog assignments.  For me, Twitter has never really worked well with how I write, as I tend to be a tad long winded, and the 140 character limit proves to be quite challenging.  For a bit of a visual aid, here's a screenshot of my Twitter account as it sits now at the end of the semester: ![Twitter](https://llcoolm495.github.io/MattENGL350/images/twitter.png) 
  I suppose I was just never able to think of anything really meaningful to post which came in under 140 characters, and although you can make threads nowadays on Twitter, the idea of such a stringent limit on words was very off-putting to me.  This is a part of the reason as to why I missed a large number of the Twitter post deadlines, though to be honest, the biggest reason for my lack of Twitter posts is due to my continuing time management issues.  With the blog posts, I was able to write in a way that just felt more, for lack of a better word, *right*.  In this regard, the blogs, although they involve much more writing, always felt more doable for me, and even fun.  It was very enjoyable to toy around with GitHub alongside writing assignments, and the blogs were quite refreshing to work on after a few years of being more or less relegated to the standard MLA sort of essay writing.  

   
 ## The Grant Project
 
  
   I won't go off on too much of a tangent and bore you, but I could (and frequently do, much to the chagrin of my friends on Discord) talk about my interest in cars and computers for hours.  I had initially planned to talk at nauseum about my current PC builds, but instead I'll drop links to my [main rig](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/LLCooLM495/saved/F6hHxr) and my auxiliary [storage server](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/LLCooLM495/saved/7jf34D) for anyone who may be interested in that sort of thing.  Here's a picture of my dorm setup at the moment as well:

  Additionally, as my membership of both Phi Mu Alpha and drumline may insinuate, I am very much into music.  I mainly play the marching tenor drums, but I also do a bit of guitar and bass guitar for fun, though I wouldn't exactly call myself proficient at anything but drums.  I enjoy listening to all sorts of music, usually while driving or studying, and if anyone cares, I'll drop the link to my [Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/Tomokohane), though it doesn't track any of the music I listen to on physical media, and I didn't make the profile until last year, so it's a bit inaccurate.
