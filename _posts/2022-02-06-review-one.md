  As far as my interest in cars, I am a member of the CNU Car Club, and I drive a 1992 Pontiac Firebird with a 3.1L V6 backed by a 700R4.  I have plans to put a more powerful drivetrain in after college, but the V6 has been phenomenally reliable for me the last 5 years, so it's staying until I can feasibly go about that kind of swap.  For now, I just keep up with maintenance, and do some small upgrades here and there, generally when I come across better equipped f-bodies which have been relegated to the local Pick-a-Part that have parts I could use.
