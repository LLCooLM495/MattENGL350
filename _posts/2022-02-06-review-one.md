# **Review One**
  
  This blog will be focusing on the [Six Degrees of Francis Bacon](http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) project.  I chose this project since I had a sort of limited familiarity with what can be considered the more contemporary form of this idea, i.e. the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.  Essentially, it is a game where you try to link various actors (or even people outside of the acting world) to Kevin Bacon, either by them having worked with him directly on a project, or even working with someone who has worked with Kevin Bacon in the past.  There are varying degrees as to how closely related someone is to Kevin Bacon, and it is a good bit of fun for anyone who's up to speed on their Kevin Bacon trivia.  However, I digress, as this is all about the Six Degrees of *Francis* Bacon, the 16th Century English philosopher.
  
## An Outsider's Perspective
  
  To try to get a feel for what the project was about before getting into the project description, I poked around on the main page of the site in an effort to simulate what the average person on the internet may go through.  Here, I was greeted with a rather intimidating sort of chart, which appeared moreso as a city planner's worst nightmare on first glance.  In this sort of preliminary stage of my exploration of the project, I was quite confused as to what exactly it was that I was looking at, feverishly attempting to comprehend the meaning of the wannabe subway network that was presented at my behest.  Clicking on the various dots of the main page of the chart leads to a massive expansion of the routes presented on the page, as is shown in this GIF I captured of my first 20 or so seconds on the site:

You can get a closer look at what exactly all these options are in this [higher resolution screenshot](https://llcoolm495.github.io/MattENGL350/images/francis.png), showing the visualization of King James I and VI, or so it says.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the most well versed in English politics, let alone English politics dating back as far as this (mid-15th Century to mid-18th Century), but I can definitely tell that the creators and contributors of the site are.  [Here](https://llcoolm495.github.io/MattENGL350/images/johnMason.png) is an example of a page that you'd get when clicking on one of the smaller circles from the King James I/ VI page, focused on a guy named John Mason, who also turns out to be the founder of New Hampshire.  Clicking on John Mason's circle brings up even more people who are connected to King James I/ VI, and each circle also gives the option to change the visualization focus to whoever you have selected. 
   
## Digging Deeper

  Once I had finished exploring the main page without any guidance, I finally opened up the [About](http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/about) page so I could get a better understanding of what exactly it was that I was looking at.  Here, in a rather concise (two sentence!) description, it is revealed that the point behind this project is to map out an early modern social network, via contributions from students around the world.  Now, as to what all of this means for the average person, I think it's safe to say that it's more of a novelty, though admittedly that kind of statement does a great disservice to the creators of this project.  For those who may be interested in this era of history, and the vast social network among the English which existed in that time, this site is surely invaluable, and could perhaps even be improved or added onto by more 15th-18th century English political enthusiasts.  
  
## Conclusion
  
  Though this likely an expected conclusion, I'd have to say that this site is, as mentioned, not much more than a novelty for a majority of people.  It is fun to click around and watch the charts reconfigure themselves, but this action seems to be more enjoyable than actually reading about any of the people you click on, especially since you only get a very brief summary of each person.  For example, here is the visualization of one John Calvert:

All that is said by this site about Calvert himself is that he was a "courtier and colonist in America"; though, there are further options at the bottom of the page to explore the various subgroups that the selected person belongs to.
