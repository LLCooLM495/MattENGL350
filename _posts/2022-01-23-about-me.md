##General Introduction
  
Hello, and welcome to my introductory blog!  My name is Matt Parsons, and I'm a 4th year here at Christopher Newport, though I am a Junior credit-wise due to a few changes to my major between my 2nd and 3rd years.  
  
##My Hobbies
  I won't go off on too much of a tangent and bore you, but I could (and frequently do, much to the chagrin of my friends on Discord) talk about my interest in cars and computers for hours.  I had initially planned to talk at nauseum about my current PC builds, but instead I'll drop links to my [main rig](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/LLCooLM495/saved/F6hHxr) and my auxiliary [storage server](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/LLCooLM495/saved/7jf34D) for anyone who may be interested in that sort of thing.
