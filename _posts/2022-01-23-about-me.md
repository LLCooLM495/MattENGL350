# **About Me**
  
## General Introduction
  
  Hello, and welcome to my introductory blog!  My name is Matt Parsons, and I'm a 4th year here at Christopher Newport, though I am a Junior credit-wise due to a few changes to my major between my 2nd and 3rd years.  I use he/him pronouns, and I am an English Major with a Minor in Philosophy (the aforementioned major changes were from Comp Sci to Bio, and Bio to English).  As far as my interest in the course, it's nice to have a bit of a break from the usual essay style assignments I get in most other English courses, and this course counts towards my major.  

## Career Interests
  
  If I'm going to be completely honest, I've still got no real idea of what I want to do after college.  I am hoping to find an internship sometime this semester where I can get in early with a good company.  I'm not really too picky, but I would like a job where I could actually work with my hands, though that may be a bit of an ask with an English degree.  I nearly dropped out after my 3rd year to pursue a career in the world of automotive mechanics, but had a good talk with my family and decided I should at least see my degree out to completion.  
  
## Academic Ventures
  
  I've been a part of the CNU Marching Band/ Pep Band since freshman year.  I started off on the cymbal line, but have been playing quads for drumline every semester since Fall 2018.  In the Spring 2019 semester, I rushed the Omicron Nu chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, America's oldest secret national fraternal society in music, and I currently serve as the Vice President and Historian.  
  
## My Hobbies
  
  I won't go off on too much of a tangent and bore you, but I could (and frequently do, much to the chagrin of my friends on Discord) talk about my interest in cars and computers for hours.  I had initially planned to talk at nauseum about my current PC builds, but instead I'll drop links to my [main rig](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/LLCooLM495/saved/F6hHxr) and my auxiliary [storage server](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/LLCooLM495/saved/7jf34D) for anyone who may be interested in that sort of thing.  Here's a picture of my dorm setup at the moment as well:

  As far as my interest in cars, I am a member of the CNU Car Club, and I drive a 1992 Pontiac Firebird with a 3.1L V6 backed by a 700R4.  I have plans to put a more powerful drivetrain in after college, but the V6 has been phenomenally reliable for me the last 5 years, so it's staying until I can feasibly go about that kind of swap.  For now, I just keep up with maintenance, and do some small upgrades here and there, generally when I come across better equipped f-bodies which have been relegated to the local Pick-a-Part that have parts I could use.

  Additionally, as my membership of both Phi Mu Alpha and drumline may insinuate, I am very much into music.  I mainly play the marching tenor drums, but I also do a bit of guitar and bass guitar for fun, though I wouldn't exactly call myself proficient at anything but drums.  I enjoy listening to all sorts of music, usually while driving or studying, and if anyone cares, I'll drop the link to my [Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/Tomokohane), though it doesn't track any of the music I listen to on physical media, and I didn't make the profile until last year, so it's a bit inaccurate.
