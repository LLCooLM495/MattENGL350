# **TEI Project Blog**
  This project was a nice change of pace for me.  I came into CNU as a Computer Science major, and didn't switch to English until the second semester of my Sophomore year.  I hadn't touched any sort of code since then, and even when I was coding, it was chiefly in Python and Java.  Having never delved into the world of XML coding, I was a bit apprehensive at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  

  
## Starting the Process
  At the start, we were all assigned passages from *Dracula's Guest*, written by Bram Stoker.  My passage was the one in which the narrator has just been woken up by some soldiers, on page 14 of this particular edition.  The raw document with my initial notations is shown in the screenshot below:

  From here, the passage was put into Oxygen XML, and the notations were transcribed into code.  The program itself was easy enough to use, and not unlike most programming software, showed whether or not your code would actually compile.  My biggest gripe with the whole project itself was actually completely unrelated to the software or programming itselfâ€“ it was with the computer.  To save you from a tangent, I'll just say that the Big Sur variant of MacOS was unintuitive for someone largely unfamiliar with Macintosh computers, and I've yet to understand why they decided to make the taskbar so finnicky to get to.  That aside, once I managed to coerce the Mac to let me navigate between different windows, it was smooth sailing.  All of the formatting required for the program was provided on my professor's website, so it was mostly a matter of going through and making the code look pretty.  Here's what the raw code looked like after I had finished:

Though I'm sure that the program would have run just the same if I'd been lazy, I felt that it was beneficial to make sure all the new paragraphs got their own line, and in the case of longer paragraphs, make sure that the code didn't exceed the boundaries of the screen.  Looking back through the code, I now realize that I, in my infinite wisdom, completely failed to regard the em-dashes, but they did appear completely normally in the finished product, so I'll just roll with it.  
 
## The Fruits of My Labour
  Finally, we're at the point where we get to look at the results of my introduction to XML programming:

I was lucky enough to have everything work correctly the first time, though that one line with the spelling correction shows up a tad strange, but I'll chalk that up to the oddball resolution on the Macbook's screen.  So, in conclusion, apart from my personal squabbles with MacOS (seriously though, it shouldn't be so annoying to get access to something as simple as a taskbar), the project was straightforward and largely successful!
