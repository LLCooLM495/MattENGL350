## Conclusion
  
  Though it is fun to click around and watch the charts reconfigure themselves, this action seems to be more enjoyable than actually reading about any of the people you click on, especially since you only get a very brief summary of each person.  For example, here is the visualization of one John Calvert:

All that is said by this site about Calvert himself is that he was a "courtier and colonist in America"; though, there are further options at the bottom of the page to explore the various subgroups that the selected person belongs to.  I wish I were able to appreciate it as these people surely would, and although I am most decidedly a bit of a fish-out-of-water on this site, I cannot help but be in awe of the effort it has taken to create a site as expansive as this on such a niche subject.
